This small project was a personal endevor, completed to improve my python skills, ETL practices, and Power Bi skills.
The project looks at the performace of Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. in the Premier League, why they underperformed, and players they can sign to imrpove the attacking output of the team.
The data obtained showed Brighton in the top 5/6 of multiple data categories (shots/shots on target/passes), but this was not reflected with their table position.
I began to investigate this, comparing Brighton's stats with the top 4 clubs in the league (File = Premier League Team Data.csv).
The key metrics analysed were Goal Creating Actions(GCA) and Shot Creating Actions(SCA)
I then looked into players in the following leagues who excelled in these categories:   
Serie A (Brazil)
Primera Division (Argentina)
Eredivisie (Netherlands)
Primeira Liga (Portugal)
A short report was done on a select few of the players.
